<body><p>Go to Google and type visual studio code, click on the first link and download it for your system mac or windows.
    When it is Downloaded Click on it and go to new project and then there you can start with your first ever coding project
    for visual studios. When done with code click on Go Live U will be directed to a place where your code is being represented
    right click on the screen and go on inspect then on inspect click console. The developer tools console is one of the most powerful tools available to you when it comes to debugging your front-end web applications. The console has an API that provides a number of methods that make debugging easier. It's not uncommon to see developers using console. log() or console.
    Right-click any page element and select Inspect Element. Click the Console tab.
    The Console is also a REPL. You can run JavaScript in the Console to interact with the page that you're inspecting. For example, Figure 2 shows the Console next to the DevTools homepage, and Figure 3 shows that same page after using the Console to change the page's title.
    Using a keyboard shortcut, open Developer Tools and bring focus to the console. Windows: Ctrl + Shift + J. Mac: Cmd + Opt +J
    The simplest is to just right-click somewhere on the page and then select 'Inspect Element' in the context-menu that appears. You can also launch the developer tools using a keyboard shortcut. The shortcut for most browsers on Mac is Alt + Command + I , for Windows you can use Ctrl + Shift + I .
